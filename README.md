Dotfile backup.

I use Windows 8 currently, which would cause vim to complain if I used .vim and .vimrc instead of vimfiles and _vimrc. I'll eventually have a proper Linux machine for development, at which time I will update directories for Linux, but for now it's possible to just rename then to .vim and .vimrc. They should work fine.

Probably.
